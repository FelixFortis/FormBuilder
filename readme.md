# FormBuilder

## Overview

This program is supposed to make building forms specific to my company easier and quicker. 

I might extend it later on to be a bit more reuseable, but right now it's just a learning exercise which deals with a specific type of form.

Rather than coding everything by hand, most of the tasks can be automated. Particularly required for longer forms such as multi page surveys.

Basic tests for functionality will also be included.

## Features

* Creating arrays of field numbers and display order numbers based on a provided range. Arrays include the all\_fields, percent\_fields, and section\_fields arrays
* Building the XML from constructed arrays which can then be fed into an external app for converting into a basic form
* Building variable definitions and assignations, validations, and styled table rows based on the converted XML
